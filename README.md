Welcome to my HTML learning repository!
Here, I practice and improve my HTML skills by creating simple webpages and experimenting with different HTML tags and concepts.

**Basic HTML structure**

✅ HTML Page Structure (<html>, <head>, <body>)

✅ Headings and Paragraphs

✅ Text Formatting and Styles

✅ Links, Images, and Videos

✅ Lists 

✅ Tables

✅ Forms and Input Elements


** Purpose of This Repository**
 
To build a strong foundation in HTML5.

To prepare for more advanced web development (CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.).

To organize all my HTML learning practice in one place.
